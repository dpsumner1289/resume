  `The year is 2020. The Mind Flayer has returned again. Except this time, it’s in project form, and the only way to fight it is to...manage it.
  ${"<br/>"}
  Enter Doug, a young developer out of Worcester, Massachusetts. He’s smart, he’s seeking employment, and he’s ready to send the Mind Flayer back to the Upside Down.
  ${"<br/>"}
  With what tools, you ask? Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and if he can learn it (he can), Ruby on Rails.
  ${"<br/>"}
  But he needs help. He needs...Basecamp. Only with Basecamp’s powers can he banish the Mind Flayer for good and save the world. 
  ${"<br/>"}
  Want to save the world together? Check out Doug’s resumé. You won’t be disappointed.
